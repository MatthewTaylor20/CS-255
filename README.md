Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, a company that helps student to study for and pass their driver tests. They wanted me to design a system that would aid in the access to the study materials and appointment setting for driving lessons. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I did a praticularly good job of meeting the requirements that they described. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that the different charts could really look better. Some of them seemed to look a bit sloppy even though they contained the information that I wanted them to contain. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The main way of doing this was to convert the transcript of the interview with them into a list of requirements. The transcript helped in being able to slowly break it down and analyze it thoroughly. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think that the most important thing that I learned about designing software is that from the very beginning, if you can ensure that the requrements and design are as defined as possible before starting the actual development, it will avoid a lot of rework and headaches down the road.
